# STM32WB55_PlantSensor
Project goal (for the first stage) is to develop an IOT System based on the STM32WB SoC to monitor soil and air Moisture as well as environment temperature.
Therefore several components will be developed including a battery powered sensor to stick into your flower pots and a base station to display and log the measurements from the sensors. 
Communication between the sensors and the base will be done via bluetooth mesh. Later more kinds of sensors may be developed as well.
